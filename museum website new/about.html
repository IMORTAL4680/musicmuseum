        <p><b>Our Story</b></p>
        <div class = "abouttext">
    In 1995 Ram Prasad Kadel began a collection of traditional Nepali folk musical instruments in an effort to curtail the impending loss of his countries precious musical heritage. Profits from Ram’s own business financed research trips & purchases of endangered folk instruments. He subsequently founded The Nepali Folk Musical Instrument Museum (NFMIM) and registered it as a charity with the Nepal Government in 1997.<br>
    By 2002 this collection had become the largest and most comprehensive in Nepal and a decision was taken to open the museum to public access in temporary premises at  Bhadrakali Temple in central Kathmandu. Finally in 2007 the museum, then holding more than 260 types of instruments, was re-housed in larger and more suitable, fully renovated, premises at Tripureswor Mahadev Temple and renamed Music Museum of Nepal (MMN).<br>
    The Museum now holds a collection of 655 distinct Nepali folk musical Instruments and over the years we have broadened our scope to encompass the rediscovery, conservation and promotion of the entire spectrum of Nepal’s traditional music and dance heritage.<br>
    Nepal has more than 100 different ethnic groups and castes, each with their own musical culture and traditions, to mark every occasion and rite of passage from birth to death and beyond. Nepalis arrange numerous musical rituals and ceremonies according to their own caste’s traditions. The professional musician castes are Gaine, Damai, Badi and Kapali but there are accomplished musicians belonging to every Nepali ethnic group and caste and our research has identified more than 1300? distinct types of folk musical instruments in this small, but culturally rich, nation.<br>
    We believe Nepali folk music culture belongs to all our peoples, from the high Himalaya to the plains of the Teraai. We wish for all to appreciate the vulnerability of their unique heritage.<br>
    Because modern western music now frequently overshadows folk music, we believe there is an urgent need to inform and involve younger people in all aspects of traditional Nepali folk music and dance.<br>
    The realization that the number of folk musicians as well as some of the less common instruments, were in rapid decline, prompted us to collect and conserve instruments, to record folk melodies, playing techniques and dance steps and to preserve the skills of instrument making crafts workers. We maintain that authentic Nepali music runs through the veins of all proud Nepali citizens.<br><br>
    
    <p><b>Our Activities</b></p><br>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Preservation and Digitisation:</b> MMN is digitising its extensive audiovisual archive of traditional Nepali music and dance, aiming to make it universally accessible for education and research. They also document instrument makers, musicians, and dancers.</li><br>
        <li><b>Educational and Community Programs:</b> The museum offers monthly workshops and concerts for university students, guided tours for school groups, music training classes, and supports poor musicians and their families with bursaries.</li><br>
        <li><b>Research and Publications:</b> MMN conducts research on folk instruments, publishes books, training manuals, audio CDs/DVDs, and transcribes melodies into musical notation. They also collect lyrics of folk songs and work on identifying endangered instruments.</li><br>
        <li><b>Public Engagement and International Collaboration:</b> The museum hosts regular concerts, promotes music festivals and competitions, forms international links with music institutions, and exhibits rare instruments at festivals with live demonstrations.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <p><b>Our Work</b></p><br>
    Current Projects:<br>
    The museum is open to the public and houses the world’s largest collection of Traditional Nepali Music Instruments and also the biggest and most comprehensive Audiovisual Archive of Traditional Nepali Music and Dance. We are continually adding newly acquired instruments and audiovisual recordings and updating the database.<br><br>
    Thanks to 2 major awards, from the Endangered Archives Programme (EAP) administered by the British Library (BL) and a smaller award from ICHCAP under the auspices of UNESCO, we have so far digitised approximately 10% of MMN’s total analogue audiovisual archive, most of which will be made available online via the BL website. We are continuing the digitisation work as and when sufficient funds become available to pay technicians salaries.<br>
    MMN has reconstructed and reintroduced some of Nepal’s extinct folk musical instruments following information gleaned from temple iconography and from the memories of senior citizens.<br>
    We publish musical instrument training manuals, other music books, audio CDs and DVDs for sale and can also provide hand crafted musical instruments to order.<br><br>
    <p><b>Future goals and hopes</b></p><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Our ideal and ultimate aim is to be able to buy land on which to erect a purpose built and permanent, facilitated Music Museum, worthy of Nepal’s vast and rich Musical Heritage.</li>
    <li>To equip a small recording studio at the museum.</li>
    <li>To continue sharing and exchanging our resources and knowledge base with other musical institutions globally.</li>
    <li>To provide educational opportunities for students and interns interested in musical and historical archiving.</li>
    <li>To continue to record historically and culturally important musical events, festivals, music and dances and the performances of master musicians including interviews with significant individuals who have historical knowledge to impart.</li>
    </ul><br>
